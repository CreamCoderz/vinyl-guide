        Greetings and welcome to Roots Vinyl Guide! This site was created to help bring some clarity to the seemingly
        frustrating world of record collecting. After following auction results on EBay, namely in the category of Reggae and Ska, I
        was left with many questions. Why is it that a similar record can vary in price by hundreds of dollars? How do you
        tell if a record is an original pressing? Who owned and operated a given record label? What is the country in which
        that record was pressed? The list goes on and on.. I noticed that more albums I manually tracked on EBay, the more I
        learned about how buyers valued records and decided to automate it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a brief summary of what is current vision for the site:
    </p>

    <p>
        This site it dedicated to Reggae and Ska auctions. Every 20 minutes it adds the results of any Ebay auction from
        this category. The crawler will only inject auctions that have received at least one bid. I believe that metric
        to
        be a reasonable sign that at least someone didn't find the price to be outrageous.
    </p>

    <p>
        Automated auction tracking can only take the site so far. Due to constant variance and miscategorization of
        auctions
        by sellers, similarity comparisons are hard to generate. Even if EBay tightened up their record auction item
        attributes (record size, record speed, etc.) there would still be the possibility of the seller's lack of
        understanding or simple human error. I plan to help alleviate this problem by community driven, manual
        categorization of auction results.
    </p>

    <p>

        It is usually clear to a record collector what record release an auction truly represents. A user of this site,
        in
        many cases, could derive the data necessary to build a release from the auction description. A user may not
        generate
        a perfectly accurate description, but the more refinement and eyes that are on these auctions, the more accurate
        our
        results will be. I have built some tools around the concept of mapping any arbitrary auction to a user generated
        release. Whenever you visit a specific auction in the future, you will see all other auctions that are mapped to
        that same release and be able to browse through the related data.
    </p>

    <p>

        There a now two main perspectives from which to view the site. The view of the auctions themselves (which will
        most
        likely always be the most common) or the view of the releases. I look at the home page as somewhat of an index
        on
        the auction view of the site. As we map and associate more data, the releases view will become interesting. The
        more
        canonical release data that we have, the more opportunity of automated auction mapping there will be in the
        future.
        You can map auction from either of these views.
    </p>

    <p>

        To map an auction:
    <ul>
        <li>
            View the details of an auction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click on the 'Map This Auction' Link (if it exists.. if it does not, then the auction is already mapped)
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter test into 'Find Releases' field to see if it already exists
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the item in the drop down menu under the search field if it does.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the release does not exist, create it using the 'Create a Release' form below
        </li>
        <li>
            In either case the page will reload and give a message about 'No other related auctions for...'
        </li>
        <li>
            You may follow this link to get a view on the release you created and all auctions mapped to it (in this
            case
            one).
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see another search field under the text 'Add Ebay Item'
        </li>
        <li>
            Enter text in this search field and click on a result that should be mapped to this release (they are easy
            to delete as well if you're not initially sure)
        </li>
        <li>
            The new auction should be displayed on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may keep repeating your search, as it will only list currently unmapped auctions'
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>

        Many thanks to all the I-Drens who visit the site regularly and in advance to anyone who wants to help. Praises!
